# multiplayerpiano

This is a p5.js application that allows you to play piano simultaneously with other people on the website. It's basically my attempt to create multiplayerpiano.com, just much more stripped down.

It's currently a work in progress, and I'm planning on limiting the piano to only play in specific pentatonic or diatonic scales or over specific chords, and changing those chords and scales periodically, so that the players always sound like they're playing over a consistent chord progression.
